      The secret key of your operator, to generate a new one you need to run:
      ```
      $ docker run --rm 'bloxstaking/ssv-node:latest' /go/bin/ssvnode generate-operator-keys
      ```
      You need to run this command in a machine that has Docker, like your DAppNode.
      
      This command will give you a PK (Public Key) and a SK (Secret Key). Make sure to back up the output of this command in a safe place and only enter the SK (Secret Key) in this field.  The SK (Secret Key) is all the characters (including special characters i.e. =) between the quotation marks (" ") directly following "{"app": "SSV-Node", "sk":"  in the output of the command.
      
      Please check the documentation [4-generate-operator-keys](https://docs.ssv.network/operators/installation-operator-1/installation-operator#4-generate-operator-keys) for more information.
