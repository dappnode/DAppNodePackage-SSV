    title: Operator Secret Key
    description: |-
      The secret key of your operator, to generate a new one you will need access to a terminal on a machine connected to the Internet with Docker installed, such as your Dappnode.  You need to run the following command :
      ```
      docker run -d --name=ssv_node_op_key -it 'bloxstaking/ssv-node:latest' \
      /go/bin/ssvnode generate-operator-keys && docker logs ssv_node_op_key --follow \
      && docker stop ssv_node_op_key && docker rm ssv_node_op_key
      ```      
      This command will generate a PK (Public Key) and a SK (Secret Key). Make sure to back up the output of this command in a safe place and only enter the SK (Secret Key) in this field.  The SK (Secret Key) is all the characters (including special characters i.e. =) between the quotation marks (" ") directly following "{"app": "SSV-Node", "sk":"  in the output of the command.
      
      Please check the official documentation from the SSV Team [here](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/installation#generate-operator-keys) for more information. 
      Note - You will need SSH or direct console access to your Dappnode in order to use it to generate your operator keys.
