# Dappnode Package SSV GÃ¶erli Testnet "Jato" V3

This package allows Dappnode Users to help test the SSV Network.  A pioneer in the field of DVT (Decentralized Validator Technology), SSV is a network of validators that use a decentralized network of operators to run their validators.  This package allows you to run an SSV Operator Node on the SSV Testnet "Jato" V3.

Note - You will need SSH or direct console access to your Dappnode in order to use it to generate your operator keys.

_Warning: This package has been modified for the Jato-V2 Testnet, which will be restarted in Mid-September 2023. SSV Jato-v1 Operators must upgrade to this version of the package or higher in order to continue operating on the network._

## Generate Operator Keys

**DO NOT** Reuse keys from the V1 "Primus" Testnet or V2 "Shifu"; You need to create new keys and register them [here](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

You'll need a keypair in order to run an operator on SSV. To generate a new keypair, you will need access to a terminal on a machine connected to the Internet with Docker installed, such as your Dappnode.  You need to run the following command :
      
      docker run -d --name=ssv_node_op_key -it 'bloxstaking/ssv-node:latest' \
      /go/bin/ssvnode generate-operator-keys && docker logs ssv_node_op_key --follow \
      && docker stop ssv_node_op_key && docker rm ssv_node_op_key
      
This command will generate a PK (Public Key) and a SK (Secret Key). Make sure to back up the output of this command in a safe place and only enter the SK (Secret Key) in this field.  The SK (Secret Key) is all the characters (including special characters i.e. =) between the quotation marks (" ") directly following "{"app": "SSV-Node", "sk":"  in the output of the command.
      
## Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate validators with SSV. This is done in the Web App linked below.

Register your new operator (**DO NOT REUSE OPERATORS FROM THE V1 "Primus" TESTNET or V2 "Shifu"**) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.
After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validator's operators.
