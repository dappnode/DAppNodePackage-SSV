# SSV Göerli Jato-V2

If you entered your SK (Secret Key) during the install of this package, you've created your Jato-V2 SSV.Network Operator!

For it to function properly, you'll have to register it with the SSV network.

## _**IMPORTANT**_

_This package requires a synced Ethereum Göerli/Prater Testnet Client Stack, as configured in the [Prater StakersUI](http://my.dappnode/#/stakers/prater) in order to function properly._

### Operator Registration

Registration is free and open to anyone who wishes to operate other validators, and is done by broadcasting a transaction to the SSV network smart contract (on the Goerli/Prater testnet) with your Operator's display name and public key that was generated as part of your node setup.

Register your new operator (_Do not reuse operators from the V1 "Primus" testnet or V2 "Shifu"_) using this [Web App](https://app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) or [https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register](https://beta.app.ssv.network/join/operator/register) **before September 18, 2023**.

After registration, your operator becomes discoverable as one of the network's operators and SSV stakers can choose you as one of their validator's operators.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/registration) to register your operator.

Full official documentation can be found [here](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/introduction).
